    <h3>Hacking:</h3>
He is known to be a prodigious hacker who is able to solve any problems related to the technology or cybersecurity. He mainly uses them for good in his vigilante adventures where he takes down men who are abusers/pedophiles/cheaters. 
High Intelligence: Elliot is shown to be very smart and intelligent which helps him in quick thinking to get out of any peril he is in. He uses his intelligence to deduce anything around him and notice small details that others miss. 
<h3>
Bravery:
</h3>
Elliot is very brave even when faced with possibility of being murdered or tortured. Unlike FBI agent Dom, who easily broke down and begged for mercy towards the Dark Army when they threatened her family, Elliot had practically gotten used to how it worked and it completely unfazed him. Most notable moments of his bravery is when he tries to save himself and Darlene from being executed by them and when he rejects Vera's advances towards him and refuses to be his partner until his therapist Krista is safe. 
<h3>
Compassion/Empathy/Humbleness: 
</h3>Despite his aloofness towards others, Elliot is shown to be very empathetic and caring towards his loved ones. He even shows kindness to those who hurt him (unless they are outright remorseless psychopaths like Vera). For example, when he decided to give Angela a second chance despite the fact she gaslit him and ruthlessly hurt his feelings and offers to take Tyrell to the hospital after he gets shot despite the fact he himself was shot by Tyrell and nearly died from his injuries because of him. He is even nice to Leon as well, even if he was revealed as a Dark Army soldier who nearly blew Darlene's brains off, though he left for him. He even refuses to be a leader because he knows he isn't a right fit for it and doesn't care about being valued or climbing up on the top, unlike Tyrell and Angela, who were obsessed with winning and being leaders who are in control of things which became their undoing.

üèÜ Quotes
</h2>
<p>
Elliot: I never want to be right about my hacks, but people always find a way to disappoint. 
<br>
Elliot: Hello friend. Hello friend? That's lame. Maybe I should give you a name. But that's a slippery slope, you're only in my head, we have to remember that. Sh*t, this actually happened, I'm talking to an imaginary person. What I'm about to tell you is top secret. A conspiracy bigger than all of us. There's a powerful group of people out there that are secretly running the world. I'm talking about the guys no one knows about, the ones that are invisible. The top 1% of the top 1%, the guys that play God without permission. And now I think they're following me.
<br> Elliot: We're all living in each other's paranoia. 
<br>Mr. Robot: The world is a dangerous place, Elliott, not because of those who do evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing. 
<br> Elliot: Oh, I don't know. Is it that we collectively thought Steve Jobs was a great man, even when we knew he made billions off the backs of children? Or maybe it's that it feels like all our heroes are counterfeit? The world itself's just one big hoax. Spamming each other with our running commentary of bullshit, masquerading as insight, our social media faking as intimacy. Or is it that we voted for this? Not with our rigged elections, but with our things, our property, our money. I'm not saying anything new. We all know why we do this, not because Hunger Games books makes us happy, but because we wanna be sedated. Because it's painful not to pretend, because we're cowards. F*** society.


<br>Elliot: A bug is never just a mistake. It represents something bigger. An error of thinking that makes you who you are.
 Whiterose: You hack people. I hack time.

<br> Mr. Robot: I'm only supposed to be your prophet; you're supposed to be my God. Mr. Robot: You're losing it, kiddo. I'm only supposed to be your prophet. You're supposed to be my God.
